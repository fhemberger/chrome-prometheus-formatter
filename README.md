# Prometheus Formatter

Chrome Extension which makes plain Prometheus metrics easier to read.

This extension is a simple syntax highlighter for plain text Prometheus metrics. As it is hard to detect whether a plain text response is coming from Prometheus, it is currently limited to '/metrics', '/federate', '/probe', '/prometheus' and '/actuator/prometheus' paths.
