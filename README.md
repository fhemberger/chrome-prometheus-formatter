# Prometheus Formatter

Chrome Extension which makes plain Prometheus metrics easier to read.

This extension is a simple syntax highlighter for plain text Prometheus metrics. 
By default it works on URL paths matching '/metrics', '/federate', '/probe', '/prometheus' and '/actuator/prometheus'. By clicking on the extension's icon, you can define your own paths (Regular Expressions are suppported), which will override the default list.
